							<h2>SUMMARY</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>This project</strong>  assessed land use change and urban sprawl in Ibadan metropolis between the years
								1984 to 2018 using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing to analyze and interpret the changes 
								for urban growth monitoring and planning. Landsat satellite images were the data used for the study. 
								Landsat images downloaded from the <a href="https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/" target="_blank">USGS Earth Explorer</a> were digitally pre-processed using ArcMap 10.6. 
								Supervised Classification was performed using <strong>Random Forest algorithm</strong> leading to the identification of 
								5 land use classes in the study area which was validated through accuracy assessment in <a href="https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/" target="_blank">Weka Software</a> with 
								reference to <a href="https://earth.google.com/web/" target="_blank">Google Earth imagery</a>.</p>
							<p>To show the trend and distribution of land use features in the study area within the period under investigation, 
								Change detection of Urban growth was evaluated by extracting urban from the classified images with the use of 
								raster calculator. Continuous urban growth was depicted i.e. 28% (1984-2000), 43% (2000-2014) and 21% (2014-2018). 
								However, the forest area coverage continued depleting to almost zero from 1984 to 2018. Findings showed that 
								expansion of urban areas has been continuous between 1984 and 2018 while forest habitat has been depleting. 
								Urban expansion in Ibadan is outwards from Ibadan city.</p>

							<p>This project examined the pattern of change in land use land cover in relation to urban expansion 
								of Ibadan from a well-known historical war camp of the Yoruba people to its present state and its 
								capacity to become a mega city, using Remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) techniques.
								This information can be used for city planning, decision-making and resource management towards sustainable urban 
								development.</p>

										<h3>DATA</h3>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										<p>The satellite images used, including Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) 
											and the Operational Land Imager (OLI) images with a 30 m spatial resolution covering the temporal 
											scenes from 1984, 2000, 2014 and 2018 were freely downloaded from the United States 
											Geological Survey (USGS) portal. The choice of the image dates was based on the assumption 
											that multi temporal images for change monitoring should be from the same season and the images in 
											the dry season are cloud-free or have low cloud cover.</p>

										<h3>Methodology</h3>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										<p>Training Sample were generated from each satellite image for five classes i.e. Urban, Vegetation, Forest, Water Body 
											and Bare Soil with reference to the false and true colour band combinations of satellite images and high-resolution 
											satellite images i.e. Google Earth. More than one training sample was used to represent a particular class. The 
											training sample polygons were selected in agreement with the Landsat Image and Google Earth.</p>
										<div class="gallery">
											<a class="landscape"><img src="images/Ibadan_Methodology.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										</div>
										<p>Random forest classifier was employed for classification tests in Spyder (Python v3.7) to produce the LULC maps. 
											These classifications were validated through an accuracy assessment process which was performed using data points 
											from satellite images in Weka software. Binary change detection technique was used where it produces only two possibilities 
											i.e. change and no change to isolate and extract urban growth from the LULC maps to illustrate the spatio-temporal change in urban growth.</p>

									<h3>LandUse LandCover Classification</h3>
								</header>
								<div class="content">
									<p>Between 1984 and 2000, the urban growth was 28% at an average rate of 3.64 SqKm per year; 2000 and 2014, there was an urban growth rate of 
										43% at an average expansion rate of 8.01 SqKm per year; and 2018 – 2014, an urban expansion of 21 SqKm was exhibited. Over the 33 years, the 
										urban growth i.e. built up areas were more than doubled, an increase from 205 km2 to 454 SqKm. This drastic change influenced the other classes 
										like forest and water which decreased and bare soil that generally increased. Bare soil changes from 404.7 SqKm in 1984, to 686.2 SqKm in 2000 and 
										then to about 938.6 SqKm in 2014. By implication, the trend shows that increase in human activities in a particular area can increase land exposure due 
										to degradation and other activities.</p>

										<a href="images/06.jpg"><img src="images/1984.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<a href="images/06.jpg"><img src="images/2000.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<a href="images/06.jpg"><img src="images/2014.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<a href="images/06.jpg"><img src="images/2018.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									</div>
									<p>The forest cover exhibited the highest amount of decrease to 0.06 Km2 in 2018 from 896.24 SqKm in 1984. Between 
										1984 and 2000, the decrease in forest coverage was 84%. A small increase of 5% was experienced between 2000 and 2014, however, a decrease 
										to 0.06 SqKm from 2014 to 2018 was exhibited. respectively. This trend shows a continuous decrease in forest areas as they are replaced by built-up 
										areas and also cleared for agriculture. The vegetation decreased from 1984 to 2014 but slightly increased by 15% from 2014 to 2018. This may be due to 
										the clearing of forests and using the land for agriculture. The relationship between the growth of Urban area, vegetation and forest is somewhat an ‘invasion’ 
										pattern where the Urban area grow and invades into the adjacent Vegetation, and the vegetation also expands outward invading into the forests.</p>

									<h3>Spatio-temporal urban growth pattern analysis </h3>
								</header>
								<div class="content">
									<div class="gallery">
										<a class="landscape"><img src="images/Graphs.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>The period between 2014 and 2018 depicts a rapid expansion as shown on the urban growth graph above. The map revealed that the morphology of 
											the urban sprawl is multi-directional with an outward growth from the city centre. The area covered by urban area increased from 205 SqKm to 263 SqKm to 376 SqKm 
											to 454 SqKm in 1984, 2000, 2014 and 2018 respectively. The period between 2000 and 2014 saw the largest growth in the Urban area. 
											However, the Period 2014 to 2018 (4 Years) exhibits a very drastic increase in the Urban Area for such a short time period.</p>
